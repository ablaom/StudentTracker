# StudentTracker

> A lightweight, single-user, database for tracking university student
> participation and grades. Written in Python 2.7

To use, clone the repository and, from within the directory of the clone, enter
"log.py" at the command line. At the prompt type <TAB> to get options.

Works if Python 2.7.13 is installed.

Successfully used by the designer at a real University but not really
intended for general use. Some documentation provided in
[database.py](database.py) and [log.py](log.py). If I would repeat the
exercise, I would probably use an SQL database and make more use of
existing libraries.
